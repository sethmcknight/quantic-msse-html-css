        <p class="about-us-text">The story of how two bakers met and fell in love is a sweet one.
            It all started at a neighborhood bake sale on a fine Sunday afternoon. They were both there to sell their delicious
            cookies and raise money for the local park. They take bake sales very seriously in Bakersville, North Carolina. Sidewalks
            are usually lined with tables and stands, and the sweet aromas fill every nook and cranny of the city. This Sunday was different, however. Word had
            spread of a deadly virus to look out for weeks before, so most Bakersville residents stayed at home this day. Charly and Jenny were the only two
            residents that didn't check the Facebook group that weekend, so as it turns out they were the only ones to set up their cookie stands. Their stands were
            about two city blocks apart, or, as they like to recount, on opposite ends of the city. Both Charly and Jenny were feeling a bit lost and disappointed
            that not a single resident had visited their stands that morning.</p>

        <p class="about-us-text">Then at roughly 12:26pm, Charly Hart smelled a hint of something wonderful.
            It was like sweet honey with a bit of roasted nuts. Then at roughly 12:28pm, Jenny Puso smelled a hint of something delightful. A deep rich chocolate with subtle notes
            of cherry. Both bakers became infatuated by the scent and couldn't help but leave their designated stands with each of their own heart-shaped cookies in hand.
            Their hearts set the sails and their noses led the way. As the distance between these bakers shortened, the aromas began to intertwine. They soon became one, as Charly and Jenny
            met face-to-face. Without exchanging a word, they handed each other their heart-shaped cookies. These cookies become windows into each other's interesting lives and sparked a wonderful
            conversation about their families and passions. At some point, Charly can't help but ask Jenny about her secret to the perfect cookie. "I think we both have the same secret ingredient,"
            Jenny replied. They looked into each other's eyes and said it in unison, "Love".</p>
