            I had wanted to be a lawyer ever since I was little.
            But for some reason, once I started blogging on the
            side after law school, my motivation to work my 9 to 5
            sort of faded away. One day I finally made the decision
            that had been looming over me for years. I created this
            blog to share my experiences and provide a new perspective
            on drastic lifestyle changes. My mantra is to always
            enjoy every moment of existence. I hope you enjoy.

            Ever wonder what it would be like to live on a desert island?
            It may have been a dream of yours since you were a child.
            Perhaps you've watched shows about the life of a castaway,
            and it seems like a fun adventure. But going from being constantly
            connected to the world around you to being alone in an unfamiliar
            place with no one to rely on for survival is something that
            not many people can wrap their minds around. So, how would you survive?
            Here are some tips on how to adapt to living in this environment...

        <h3>An Argument Against Sand <span class="date">-posted on January 23rd</span></h3>

            I've been here for 3 days and I am already questioning my decision.
            My skin is literally drying up, the temperature is too hot, the air feels like fire,
            and everything smells like sand. This place has absolutely nothing that I need or want.
            The weather is miserable and there's absolutely no sun because it's always cloudy.
            All I want to do is go back home where my skin can breathe and my trousers have less sand.
            Hopefully these feelings pass soon, I think I might just need some coffee...

            When I arrived on the island it was just like I had pictured:
            lush green palm trees everywhere, stunningly blue water that
            stretches out for miles to shake hands with the equally stunning sky.
            But things have gotten bad here. I miss my family, my sister's dog
            and the better food. I'm also running out of clothes and I need help...

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am an adventurous fellow who makes time for spontaneity
            in my life by exploring new places, tasting new foods, and
            trying out new hobbies. I blog about my adventures around
            the world and what I learn as a result. Recently I've started
            a new life on an island and hope to document every meaningful
            moment along the way.</p>
